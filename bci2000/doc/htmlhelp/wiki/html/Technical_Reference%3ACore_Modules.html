<a name="Data_Acquisition_Module"></a><h2>Data Acquisition Module</h2>
<p>The role of the EEG Data Acquisition (or Source) module is to wait for data
blocks
coming in from the A/D hardware, and to send these blocks of data on
to Signal
Processing, thus acting as the on-line system's "metronome"
synchronized to
the A/D hardware clock.
At the same time, it receives state vector information from the
Application
module, and saves this state vector information to a file in BCI2000
.dat
format, together with the raw digitized data.
During normal operation (<i>Running</i>  is 1), the EEG source module
runs in a data acquisition loop that basically reads
</p>
<pre>
1: While Running
2:   Save state vector to file
3:   Wait for A/D data
4:   Send A/D data to Signal Processing
5:   Wait for state vector from Application
6:   Save A/D data to file
</pre>
<p>Note that statement 3 as well as statement 5 are blocking operations,
i.e.,
the module will wait for A/D data as well as for the state vector data
coming in from the Application module.
This mode of operation requires a sufficiently fast system to work
properly.
For our purposes, a "fast" system is a system where
</p>
<ul><li>synchronous I/O operations (2, 4, 5, and 6) require an execution time that is small compared to the duration of a data block (as given by the sampling rate and the sample block size), and 
</li><li>the time required by the Signal Processing and Application modules for processing the data sent out in statement 4 is small compared to the duration of a data block. 
</li></ul>
<p>In an on-line system, the time between sampling of a data block, and
display
of the resulting feedback information to the subject, is critical.
Given a "sufficiently fast" system as defined above, only statement 4
will enter
into this critical time path, while the time spent on execution of the
remaining
statements will reduce the waiting interval occurring in statement 3.

<a name="Signal_Processing_Module"></a><h2>Signal Processing Module</h2>
<a name="Overview"></a><h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Signal Processing acts like a black box to the rest of the system - it receives EEG signals from the Data Acquisition and sends control signals on to the Application. 
</p><p>The data flow in a typical implementation is as follows:
</p>
<pre>selected channels from data acquisition -> [Spatial Filter] -> spatially filtered signal
-> [Temporal Filter] -> temporally filtered signal -> [Classifier] -> control signal
-> [Normalizer] -> normalized control signal to go to application
</pre>
<p>There are basically 4 main filters (Spatial Filter, Temporal Filter, Classifier, and
Normalizer) connected in form of a pipe: Each filter's output is the input to the next filter, and all filters act on each input block of data in sequence.
For each input block of data, there must be a resulting output block.
</p>
<a name="Goals"></a><h3>Goals</h3>
<p>One of the goals for BCI2000 is for each module to be as independent of the others as possible. 
For example, Signal Processing should not have to take the type of data collection
hardware into account. For the same reason, Application should (ideally) not have to
know about the signal processing method used. While in real-world situations this will not be possible, control signals shall be zero mean (to the extent that this is possible), shall be normalized to unit gain, and each value shall be equally accessible by the user's
brain signals.
In this fashion, the interdependence between Signal Processing and
Application can be minimized.
</p>
<a name="Assumptions_and_Dependencies"></a><h3>Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
<p>Signal Processing can contain instances of multiple filter classes.
These filter
classes cannot assume any specific values for
<i>SampleBlockSize</i>,
<i>SamplingRate</i>, or <i>TransmitCh</i>. They have to be able to
adapt their functionality according to these three parameters -- they might
not only be used in scenarios with varying parameters, but they might also have
to work together with other filters. Therefore, hard coded assumptions about
these three parameters have to be avoided.
</p>
<a name="Application_Module"></a><h2>Application Module</h2>
<p>One major goal for
BCI2000 system design is the independence between modules. In most BCI
systems, however, some parts of the applied signal processing module (i.e., the device-dependent part of signal processing) depend on the feedback to the user - a feature
provided by the user application module.
This inter-dependence between the signal processing and the user
application modules poses severe problems to the system design, because it is not possible to
completely encapsulate each module and separate it from others.
In order to minimize inter-dependence, duties should be performed by the module that is conceptually defining the feature. For example, task paradigm and timing are, conceptually, parts of a task and should therefore be handled by the user application module.
<a href="User_Reference%253ACursorTask.html" title="User Reference:CursorTask">User Reference:CursorTask</a> an implementation of a such a user task - a simple cursor task - that complies with the idea of minimal inter-dependence.
